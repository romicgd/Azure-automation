# Azure Automation Scripts

The list of automation categories with brief descriptions is below. Additional descriptions are provided in each folder Readme (at least I try to).

No warranties - please use at your own risk - it works for me... :)

- ```PKI``` Functions to manage certificates and keys in Azure 
- ```ApplicationGateway``` Scripts to manage Azure Application Gateway (e.g. to add back-end endpoints and ports)
- ```AppService``` Scripts to manage Azure App Service (e.g add network IP restrictions)
- ```AzureAD``` Script to manage and collection Azure AD information (applications, privileges etc)
- ```LogicApps``` Script to deploy and manage Logic Apps
